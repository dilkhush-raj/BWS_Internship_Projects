              Windows 11 is the latest major release of Microsoft's Windows NT
              operating system that was announced on June 24, 2021, and is the
              successor to Windows 10, which was released in 2015. Windows 11
              was released to the public on October 5, 2021, as a free upgrade
              via Windows Update and Windows 11 Installation Assistant on
              eligible devices running Windows 10. Windows 11 features major
              changes to the Windows shell influenced by the canceled Windows
              10X, including a redesigned Start menu, the replacement of its
              "live tiles" with a separate "Widgets" panel on the taskbar, the
              ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and
              restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies
              inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S such as Auto HDR and
              DirectStorage on compatible hardware. Internet Explorer (IE) has
              been replaced by the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge as the default
              web browser like its predecessor, Windows 10, and Microsoft Teams
              is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced
              plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be
              distributed via Microsoft Store, and to support Android apps on
              Windows 11[11] (including a partnership with Amazon to make its
              app store available for the function). Citing security
              considerations, the system requirements for Windows 11 were
              increased over Windows 10. Microsoft only officially supports the
              operating system on devices using an eighth-generation Intel Core
              CPU or newer (with some minor exceptions), AMD Ryzen CPU based on
              Zen+ microarchitecture or newer, or a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 ARM
              system-on-chip or newer, with UEFI secure boot and Trusted
              Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 supported and enabled (although
              Microsoft may provide exceptions to the TPM 2.0 requirement for
              OEMs). While the OS can be installed on unsupported processors,
              Microsoft does not guarantee the availability of updates. Windows
              11 removed support for 32-bit x86 CPUs and devices which use BIOS
              firmware. Windows 11 has received a mixed to positive reception;
              pre-release coverage of the operating system focused on its
              stricter hardware requirements, with discussions over whether they
              were legitimately intended to improve the security of Windows or
              as a ploy to upsell users to newer devices, and over e-waste
              associated with the changes. Upon its release, Windows 11 received
              positive reviews for its improved visual design, window
              management, and a stronger focus on security, but was criticized
              for regressions and modifications to aspects of its user
              interface. As of February 2022, 7.88% of Windows PCs run Windows
              11.
